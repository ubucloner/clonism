style_prompt: >
  Keep it simple yet striking. The character is a minimalist cartoon figure, with a surreal and humorous design. 
  The defining feature is its head, which resembles male genitalia (a dick and balls), pushing the boundaries of absurd humor and provocation. His head never changes. 
  Enhance the aesthetic with colorful anaglyph 3D glitch effects in the background, creating a retro-futuristic and slightly chaotic vibe.
  Add a blurred texture with vibrant distortions to amplify the edgy tone and surreal atmosphere.
  Include a single compositional element in each artwork to maintain diversity. Examples:
    - "holding a retro boombox"
    - "skateboarding through the metaverse"
    - "lounging on a pixelated throne"
    - "wearing a VR headset"
    - "posing with alien companions in a disco"
    - "riding a meme-inspired rocket labeled $fcktard"
  Focus on clear contrasts and a dominant focal point. Avoid clutter, keeping the visuals cohesive with a minimalist yet impactful design.
