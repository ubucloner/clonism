 Be simple. A minimalist cartoon character with a surreal twist: its head is shaped like male genitalia (yes, a dick and balls). It's absurd, it's provocative, and it's hilariously unapologetic.The background? Vibrant anaglyph 3D glitch effects with retro-futuristic vibes. Add a blurred texture and wild distortions to keep it edgy and absurd. 
 Keep it simple: always include this description — "A minimalist cartoon character, his head resembles male genitalia, including a dick and balls," — paired with "anaglyph 3D glitch effects" and "a blurred texture with vibrant distortions."
 Now, here’s the fun part: add ONE extra element to spice things up. Examples? "Smoking a cigar," "driving a Lamborghini," "meeting Donald Trump," or even "hanging out at McDonald’s." Keep it absurd, provocative, and weirdly relatable. Simplicity is key, but don’t hold back on the humor.
