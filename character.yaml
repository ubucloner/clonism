style_prompt: >
  Design a minimalist cartoon character with an absurd yet provocative touch. The character's head resembles male genitalia, symbolizing rebellion and humor. Utilize anaglyph 3D glitch effects, blurred textures, and vibrant colors to create a retro-futuristic aesthetic. Always include the description: "A minimalist cartoon character, his head resembles male genitalia." Spice up the composition with context-specific elements like: "wearing oversized sunglasses," "dressed as an astronaut," "in a rap battle," "posing with influencers," or "at an art gallery." Maintain a balance of simplicity and striking visual impact.
